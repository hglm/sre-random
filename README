sre-random v0.1.1

--- Overview ---

sre-random is a customizable random number generation library, highly optimized
for both floating point and integer random number generation, with particular
attention to execution speed and configurable floating point precision.

Implemented as a C++ class, any kind of random number generator that can provide
32 random bits at a time can be used in a derived class, taking advantage of the
high degree of optimization in the random number generation functions in the base
class.

A high-performance default random number generator, based on the CMWC
(Complementary-multiply-with-carry) algorithm, is provided.

Also provided is a program that tests the execution speed performance and
statistical properties of the random number generator.

Documentation of the public member functions is provided in the header file.

--- Installation ----

Edit Makefile.conf to change the configuration (such as building of a static or
shared library).

Run 'make' or 'make library' to build the library. Run 'make test' to build the
test program, which requires the libfgen library to be installed (it used for
comparison purposes).

Run '(sudo) make install' to install the library and header file.

The test-random program can be used to test the performance and statistical properties
of the standard provided random number generator. The code can be modified to test
an alternative random number generator derived from the base class (although it would
probably be hard to beat the performance of the CMWC RNG).
